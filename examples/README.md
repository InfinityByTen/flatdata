Flatdata Usage Examples
=======================

This folder contains examples of flatdata usage. Those are meant to show how
to use serialization/deserialization APIs and different resource types available.

Binary Layout Example
---------------------

This example writes a simple not aligned data structure (23 bits long) to a flatdata vector.
The structure is filled with ones and zeroes to make it easier to see how different fields are
stored.

Two structures are written to the output to show the structure alignment and padding.
